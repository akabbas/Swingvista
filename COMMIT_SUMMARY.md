## üîß Key Fixes

### 1. Weight Distribution Calculation (CRITICAL FIX)
**Problem**: Weight distribution was showing 100% on both feet (sums to 200%), should sum to 100% total.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed normalization logic in all weight distribution calculations
- Ensured `rightWeight = 100 - leftWeight` to guarantee exact 100% total
- Added validation to detect and warn about invalid distributions

**Files Changed**:
- `src/lib/weight-distribution-analysis.ts` (lines 200-210)
- `src/lib/swing-phases.ts` (lines 357-362)
- `src/lib/accurate-swing-metrics.ts` (lines 775-780)
- `src/lib/golf-metrics.ts` (lines 314-320)

### 2. Phase Detection Accuracy
**Problem**: Not correctly identifying swing phases in real-time throughout the entire swing cycle.

**Solution**:
- Created `EnhancedPhaseDetector` class with accurate biomechanical analysis
- Implemented proper phase detection algorithms for all 6 phases:
  - Address: Balanced weight, club behind ball, minimal movement
  - Backswing: Club moving up and back, increasing shoulder turn
  - Top: Maximum shoulder turn, club parallel to ground, weight transfer started
  - Downswing: High club speed, club moving down and forward
  - Impact: Maximum club speed, club at ball position, weight transfer complete
  - Follow-through: Club past impact, body continuing rotation

**Files Created**:
- `src/lib/enhanced-phase-detector.ts` (complete implementation)

### 3. Real-time Analysis
**Problem**: Must work for both live camera analysis and uploaded videos.

**Solution**:
- Created enhanced camera page with real-time phase detection
- Integrated enhanced phase detector with live camera feed
- Added real-time weight distribution and club position tracking

**Files Created**:
- `src/app/camera-enhanced/page.tsx` (complete implementation)

### 4. Body Position Accuracy
**Problem**: Use correct body landmarks for phase detection.

**Solution**:
- Updated landmark indices to use correct MediaPipe landmarks:
  - Ankles: 27 (left), 28 (right)
  - Hips: 23 (left), 24 (right)
  - Shoulders: 11 (left), 12 (right)
  - Wrists: 15 (left), 16 (right)
- Improved weight distribution calculation using hip center position relative to ankle center

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/enhanced-phase-detector.ts` (lines 68-104, 121-149, 154-175)

### 5. Validation and Debugging
**Problem**: Need validation to prevent impossible states and debugging tools.

**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive validation functions
- Added real-time validation for weight distribution (must sum to 100%)
- Implemented phase sequence validation
- Added debugging tools with detailed logging

**Files Created**:
- `src/lib/phase-validation.ts` (complete implementation)

## üß™ Testing

### Test Files Created:
- `test-phase-detection-fix.html` - Unit tests for validation
- `test-video-phase-detection.html` - Comprehensive video test with real-time analysis
- `test-phase-fixes.js` - Command-line test script

### Test Coverage:
1. **Weight Distribution Tests**: Verify all calculations sum to exactly 100%
2. **Phase Detection Tests**: Validate correct phase identification
3. **Real-time Analysis Tests**: Test live camera and video analysis
4. **Body Position Tests**: Verify correct landmark usage
5. **Validation Tests**: Test error detection and debugging tools
