- Weight Transfer: ${metrics.weightTransfer?.transfer ? (metrics.weightTransfer.transfer * 100).toFixed(1) : 'N/A'}% (Ideal: 80-90%)
- Shoulder Rotation: ${metrics.rotation?.shoulderRotation || 'N/A'}¬∞
- Hip Rotation: ${metrics.rotation?.hipRotation || 'N/A'}¬∞
- X-Factor (Shoulder-Hip Separation): ${metrics.rotation?.xFactor || 'N/A'}¬∞
- Swing Plane Deviation: ${metrics.swingPlane?.deviation || 'N/A'}¬∞
- Club Path: ${metrics.clubPath?.insideOut || 'N/A'}¬∞ (Positive = inside-out)
- Impact Hands Position: ${metrics.impact?.handPosition || 'N/A'} inches ahead of ball
- Body Alignment: ${metrics.bodyAlignment?.headMovement || 'N/A'} inches head movement
- Follow-Through Extension: ${metrics.followThrough?.extension ? (metrics.followThrough.extension * 100).toFixed(1) : 'N/A'}%

SWING CHARACTERISTICS:
- Backswing Length: ${characteristics.backswingLength}
- Downswing Timing: ${characteristics.downswingTiming}ms
- Impact Consistency: ${characteristics.impactConsistency}%
- Finish Balance: ${characteristics.finishBalance}
- Swing Speed: ${characteristics.swingSpeed} mph
- Club Path Consistency: ${characteristics.clubPathConsistency}%
- Tempo Consistency: ${characteristics.tempoConsistency}%

Please provide professional analysis focusing on:
1. What the golfer is doing well (specific strengths)
2. The most important areas for improvement
3. Specific drills and exercises for each improvement area
4. One key tip that will make the biggest difference
5. Professional insight about their swing mechanics
6. Next steps for continued improvement

Be encouraging but honest, specific but not overwhelming, and always provide actionable advice.
