## 📊 Available Data

### Pose Data (33 landmarks per frame):
- **Face**: 11 landmarks (nose, eyes, ears, mouth)
- **Arms**: 6 landmarks (shoulders, elbows, wrists)
- **Hands**: 6 landmarks (fingers, thumbs)
- **Hips**: 2 landmarks (left/right hip)
- **Legs**: 8 landmarks (knees, ankles, feet)

### Swing Phases:
- **Address**: 0-20% of swing
- **Backswing**: 20-40% of swing
- **Top of Swing**: 40-60% of swing
- **Downswing**: 60-80% of swing
- **Follow-through**: 80-100% of swing

### Club Path Data:
- **Magenta Trail**: Club head position throughout swing
- **Swing Plane**: Shoulder-to-hip alignment
- **Phase Markers**: Color-coded swing phases

## 🚧 Current Challenges

### 1. **AI Grading Implementation**
**Problem**: Need to convert pose data into meaningful swing scores
**Available Data**: 33 landmarks per frame, swing phases, club path
**Approach**: Start with basic metrics (swing plane, tempo, balance)

### 2. **Swing Metrics Calculation**
**Problem**: How to calculate professional golf metrics from pose data
**Examples Needed**:
- Swing plane angle calculation
- Tempo ratio (backswing vs downswing time)
- Balance analysis (weight transfer)
- Club path consistency

### 3. **Professional Feedback Generation**
**Problem**: How to provide actionable coaching advice
**Approach**: Rule-based system initially, ML enhancement later
