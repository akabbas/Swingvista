# Component Testing Checklist

## ✅ CONFIRMED WORKING
- **Stick Figure Detection** - Pose tracking aligns with golfer's body

## 🧪 NEEDS TESTING

### 1. Club Path Visualization (Magenta Trail)
**What to test:**
- [ ] Magenta trail appears and follows hand movement
- [ ] Trail is smooth and continuous (not jumping around)
- [ ] Trail builds up over time showing swing path
- [ ] No frozen or teleporting dots

**How to test:**
1. Upload a golf swing video
2. Enable "Club Path" overlay in settings
3. Play video and watch for magenta trail
4. Check browser console for club path logs

### 2. Swing Plane Analysis
**What to test:**
- [ ] Swing plane line appears (cyan dashed line)
- [ ] Line connects shoulders to hips appropriately
- [ ] Line updates as golfer moves through swing
- [ ] "SWING PLANE" label appears

**How to test:**
1. Enable "Swing Plane" overlay
2. Look for cyan line between shoulders and hips
3. Verify line follows golfer's torso movement

### 3. Phase Detection Markers
**What to test:**
- [ ] Phase indicators appear (ADDRESS, BACKSWING, DOWNSWING, etc.)
- [ ] Phases change as video progresses
- [ ] Progress bar shows swing completion
- [ ] Phase colors are distinct and visible

**How to test:**
1. Enable "Phase Markers" overlay
2. Watch for colored phase boxes
3. Verify phases change during swing

### 4. Golf Swing Analysis Metrics
**What to test:**
- [ ] Analysis completes without errors
- [ ] Letter grade is assigned (A, B, C, D, F)
- [ ] Numerical score is provided
- [ ] Detailed metrics are calculated
- [ ] AI feedback is generated

**How to test:**
1. Upload video and wait for analysis
2. Check analysis results panel
3. Verify metrics like tempo, rotation, weight transfer

### 5. Video Playback Controls
**What to test:**
- [ ] Play/pause buttons work
- [ ] Speed controls function (0.25x, 0.5x, 0.75x, 1.0x)
- [ ] Mute/unmute toggle works
- [ ] Overlay show/hide works
- [ ] Video loads and plays smoothly

**How to test:**
1. Test all control buttons
2. Try different playback speeds
3. Toggle overlays on/off
4. Test mute functionality

### 6. Overlay Settings Panel
**What to test:**
- [ ] All overlay toggles work independently
- [ ] Settings persist during playback
- [ ] Settings reset for new videos
- [ ] UI is responsive and clear

**How to test:**
1. Toggle each overlay setting
2. Verify overlays appear/disappear
3. Test combinations of settings

## 🐛 COMMON ISSUES TO WATCH FOR

### Club Path Issues
- Trail not appearing → Check console for "DRAW CLUB PATH" logs
- Trail jumping around → Look for coordinate validation errors
- No trail at all → Check if club head detection is working

### Swing Plane Issues
- Line not appearing → Check shoulder/hip landmark detection
- Wrong line position → Verify MoveNet indices (5,6,11,12)
- Line not updating → Check pose data quality

### Phase Detection Issues
- Phases not changing → Check frame counting logic
- Wrong phase timing → Verify swing progression detection
- Missing phases → Check pose data availability

### Analysis Issues
- Analysis fails → Check for pose detection errors
- Low scores → Verify pose data quality
- Missing metrics → Check analysis pipeline

## 🔧 DEBUGGING TIPS

### Browser Console Logs to Watch For:
- `🎨 DRAW CLUB PATH` - Club path rendering
- `🏌️ DETECTING CLUB HEAD` - Club head detection
- `🎨 Drawing swing plane` - Swing plane rendering
- `🎨 Drawing phase markers` - Phase detection
- `🏌️ UNIFIED ANALYSIS` - Analysis pipeline

### Error Messages to Look For:
- `❌ No club head history available` - Club path issue
- `❌ No landmarks for frame` - Pose data issue
- `❌ Invalid coordinates` - Coordinate mapping issue
- `❌ Analysis failed` - Analysis pipeline issue

## 📋 TESTING PROCEDURE

1. **Upload a clear golf swing video** (good lighting, full body visible)
2. **Enable all overlays** in settings panel
3. **Play video at 0.5x speed** for detailed observation
4. **Check browser console** for any error messages
5. **Test each overlay individually** by toggling settings
6. **Verify analysis results** after video processing

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

- All overlays appear and function correctly
- No console errors during playback
- Analysis completes with realistic scores
- Video controls work smoothly
- Overlays align with golfer's actual movement

## 📞 IF ISSUES FOUND

1. **Note the specific problem** (which overlay, what behavior)
2. **Check browser console** for error messages
3. **Try different video** to isolate the issue
4. **Test individual overlays** to narrow down the problem
5. **Report findings** with specific details
