- Added pose smoothing to reduce jitter between frames
- Implemented quality validation to skip poor detection frames
- Enhanced landmark validation with bounds checking

### 2. **Club Path Tracking**
**Problem**: Magenta club path was not accurately following the golf club head
**Impact**: Incorrect swing plane analysis and club path visualization
**Solutions Implemented**:
- Rewrote club head detection algorithm for golf-specific tracking
- Implemented 3-tier detection system (hand position, shoulder fallback, phase-based)
- Added swing phase awareness for different parts of the swing
- Enhanced visual indicators with confidence-based pulsing

### 3. **Video Processing Performance**
**Problem**: Frame skipping and poor animation performance
**Impact**: Inaccurate analysis and poor user experience
**Solutions Implemented**:
- Implemented requestAnimationFrame-based animation loop
- Added comprehensive progress tracking with detailed steps
- Optimized frame processing for 30fps analysis
- Enhanced debugging with real-time performance monitoring

### 4. **Camera Angle Compatibility**
**Problem**: Pose detection failed on diagonal camera angles
**Impact**: System only worked on front-facing videos
**Solutions Implemented**:
- Lowered confidence thresholds for better diagonal angle detection
- Added adaptive skeleton drawing with distance validation
- Implemented color-coded keypoints for better visual feedback
- Enhanced connection drawing with stricter validation

## 📊 Current System Status

### ✅ Working Well:
- **Tiger Woods Sample Videos**: Perfect tracking and analysis
- **Front-facing Videos**: Excellent pose detection and overlay accuracy
- **Progress Tracking**: Comprehensive loading system with detailed feedback
- **UI/UX**: Clean, professional interface with smooth interactions

### ⚠️ Areas Needing Improvement:
- **Diagonal Camera Angles**: Still some accuracy issues on certain angles
- **Club Path Accuracy**: Needs refinement for different swing styles
- **AI Grading**: Core grading algorithms need implementation
- **Performance**: Optimization needed for longer videos

## 🎯 Next Development Priorities

3. **Balance Analysis**: Evaluate weight transfer and balance throughout swing
4. **Club Path Analysis**: Grade club path consistency and shape

### Phase 2: Advanced Metrics (Short-term)
1. **Weight Transfer Analysis**: Track hip and shoulder movement patterns
2. **Swing Arc Analysis**: Measure swing width and depth
3. **Timing Analysis**: Evaluate sequence of movements
4. **Power Analysis**: Calculate swing speed and efficiency

### Phase 3: AI Enhancement (Medium-term)
1. **Machine Learning Integration**: Train models on professional swing data
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify common swing faults automatically
3. **Personalized Feedback**: Custom recommendations based on swing style
4. **Progress Tracking**: Compare swings over time
