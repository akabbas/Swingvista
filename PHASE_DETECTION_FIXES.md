# Phase Detection & Weight Distribution Fixes

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive fixes implemented for weight distribution calculation and phase detection accuracy in the SwingVista golf swing analysis system.

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. Weight Distribution Calculation (CRITICAL FIX)
**Problem**: Weight distribution was showing 100% on both feet (sums to 200%), should sum to 100% total.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed normalization logic in all weight distribution calculations
- Ensured `rightWeight = 100 - leftWeight` to guarantee exact 100% total
- Added validation to detect and warn about invalid distributions
- Updated multiple files: `weight-distribution-analysis.ts`, `swing-phases.ts`, `accurate-swing-metrics.ts`, `golf-metrics.ts`

**Code Example**:
```typescript
// OLD (BROKEN)
leftFootWeight = Math.max(0, Math.min(100, (compensated.leftFoot / total) * 100));
rightFootWeight = Math.max(0, Math.min(100, (compensated.rightFoot / total) * 100));

// NEW (FIXED)
leftFootWeight = Math.max(0, Math.min(100, (compensated.leftFoot / total) * 100));
rightFootWeight = 100 - leftFootWeight; // Ensure exact 100% total
```

### 2. Phase Detection Accuracy
**Problem**: Not correctly identifying swing phases in real-time throughout the entire swing cycle.

**Solution**:
- Created `EnhancedPhaseDetector` class with accurate biomechanical analysis
- Implemented proper phase detection algorithms for all 6 phases:
  - Address: Balanced weight, club behind ball, minimal movement
  - Backswing: Club moving up and back, increasing shoulder turn
  - Top: Maximum shoulder turn, club parallel to ground, weight transfer started
  - Downswing: High club speed, club moving down and forward
  - Impact: Maximum club speed, club at ball position, weight transfer complete
  - Follow-through: Club past impact, body continuing rotation

**Key Features**:
- Real-time phase tracking with transition logging
- Confidence scoring for each phase detection
- Historical phase tracking for analysis

### 3. Real-time Analysis
**Problem**: Must work for both live camera analysis and uploaded videos.

**Solution**:
- Created `camera-enhanced/page.tsx` with real-time phase detection
- Integrated enhanced phase detector with live camera feed
- Added real-time weight distribution and club position tracking
- Implemented frame-by-frame analysis with performance monitoring

### 4. Body Position Accuracy
**Problem**: Use correct body landmarks for phase detection.

**Solution**:
- Updated landmark indices to use correct MediaPipe landmarks:
  - Ankles: 27 (left), 28 (right)
  - Hips: 23 (left), 24 (right)
  - Shoulders: 11 (left), 12 (right)
  - Wrists: 15 (left), 16 (right)
- Improved weight distribution calculation using hip center position relative to ankle center
- Enhanced club head position estimation using wrist positions

### 5. Validation and Debugging
**Problem**: Need validation to prevent impossible states and debugging tools.

**Solution**:
- Created `phase-validation.ts` with comprehensive validation functions
- Added real-time validation for weight distribution (must sum to 100%)
- Implemented phase sequence validation
- Added debugging tools with detailed logging
- Created test page `test-phase-detection-fix.html` for validation

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `src/lib/enhanced-phase-detector.ts` - Main enhanced phase detection system
- `src/lib/phase-validation.ts` - Validation and debugging tools
- `src/app/camera-enhanced/page.tsx` - Enhanced camera page with real-time analysis
- `test-phase-detection-fix.html` - Comprehensive test page for validation

### Modified Files:
- `src/lib/weight-distribution-analysis.ts` - Fixed weight distribution calculation
- `src/lib/swing-phases.ts` - Updated weight distribution and phase detection
- `src/lib/accurate-swing-metrics.ts` - Fixed weight distribution calculation
- `src/lib/golf-metrics.ts` - Updated weight distribution function signature

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Weight Distribution Algorithm:
```typescript
function calculateWeightDistribution(pose: PoseResult): WeightDistribution {
  // Get foot landmarks
  const leftAnkle = pose.landmarks[27];
  const rightAnkle = pose.landmarks[28];
  
  // Calculate pressure based on vertical position
  const leftFootPressure = calculateFootPressure(leftAnkle);
  const rightFootPressure = calculateFootPressure(rightAnkle);
  
  // Normalize to sum to 100%
  const totalPressure = leftFootPressure + rightFootPressure;
  const leftPercent = Math.round((leftFootPressure / totalPressure) * 100);
  const rightPercent = 100 - leftPercent; // CRITICAL: Ensure exact 100%
  
  return { left: leftPercent, right: rightPercent, total: 100 };
}
```

### Phase Detection Algorithm:
```typescript
function detectSwingPhase(poses: PoseResult[], currentFrame: number): SwingPhase {
  const currentPose = poses[currentFrame];
  const clubPosition = calculateClubHeadPosition(currentPose);
  const bodyRotation = calculateBodyRotation(currentPose);
  const weightDistribution = calculateWeightDistribution(currentPose);
  
  // Phase-specific detection logic
  if (isAddressPhase(currentPose, weightDistribution)) return 'address';
  if (isBackswingPhase(currentPose, clubPosition, bodyRotation)) return 'backswing';
  if (isTopOfSwingPhase(currentPose, clubPosition, bodyRotation, weightDistribution)) return 'top';
  if (isDownswingPhase(currentPose, clubPosition, swingVelocity)) return 'downswing';
  if (isImpactPhase(currentPose, clubPosition, swingVelocity, weightDistribution)) return 'impact';
  if (isFollowThroughPhase(currentPose, clubPosition, bodyRotation)) return 'follow-through';
  
  return 'address';
}
```

- ‚úÖ **Debugging Tools**: Comprehensive validation and error detection

## üîç Debugging

### Weight Distribution Debugging:
```typescript
const validation = validateWeightDistribution(left, right);
if (!validation.isValid) {
  console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è Weight distribution validation failed:', validation.error);
}
```

### Phase Transition Logging:
```typescript
logPhaseTransition(previousPhase, newPhase, currentTime, weightDistribution);
```

### Debug Information Display:
```typescript
const debugInfo = displayCurrentPhase(phase, weightDistribution, clubPosition);
console.log(debugInfo);
```

## üìà Performance Considerations

- Frame rate monitoring with 60 FPS target
- Processing time tracking (target < 50ms per frame)
- Landmark visibility validation (minimum 50% quality)
- Memory management for pose history (limited to 20 frames)

## üéØ Next Steps

2. **Testing**: Run comprehensive tests with real golf swing videos
3. **Optimization**: Fine-tune phase detection thresholds based on real data
4. **UI Enhancement**: Add visual indicators for phase transitions and weight distribution
5. **Analytics**: Track phase detection accuracy and user feedback
